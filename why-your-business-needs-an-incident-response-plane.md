Incident response refers to the cleanup and recovery from a security attack. Nowadays, attacks such as advanced persistent threats (APTs) are increasing in number and complexity. To deal successfully with these attacks, or other security incidents, you need to have a detailed plan, as well as a dedicated team to manage the incident, minimizing the damage to business operations and reducing the cost of recovery. In this article, I’ll explain what is an incident response plan, why you need one and how to implement it effectively.

## What Is An Incident Response Plan?
An incident response plan is a detailed set of instructions to help information security staff detect, respond to and recover from cybersecurity incidents. Put simply, the plan is the guide detailing the steps to follow in case of an attack, including who is responsible to search for threats, who is in charge of implementing response measures, and what measures to take. 

The plan should address all possible attack scenarios depending on the organization’s vulnerabilities, from brute force attacks to ransomware and data breaches. It should also take into consideration service outages that threaten daily work.

Successful incident response plans help your team save crucial time in the event of an attack when every minute counts. When dealing with data breach incidents, it is especially important to have an updated, functional incident response plan, so the security team can act promptly and minimize data loss as much as possible. 

## Why Your Business Needs An Incident Response Plan?
It is important to have an incident response plan in place to avoid being caught unprepared by an attacker, making ad-hoc decisions that end up costing time, data and money. 
Thus, the top three reasons to develop an incident response plan are: 
 
**1. Data protection**
As mentioned above, one of the main benefits of having an incident response plan in place is been able to minimize data loss during an incident. A well laid plan can help your team to proactively protect your data from being stolen or misused. For example, data that falls in the wrong hands can be held for ransom. Since [ransomware](https://www.us-cert.gov/Ransomware) (WannaCry, Petya) is one of the most common types of attack nowadays, it is important to follow proper procedures to ensure no data is leaked. 
 
This involves performing secure backups at scheduled times, leveraging logs and generating security alerts to inform of malicious activities, as well as proper access management to avoid insider threats. 
 
**2. Reputation and customer trust protection**
Most customers will leave a business if they are affected by a data breach. A security breach can make a company lose some or all its customer base, making it very hard to rebuild trust, and staying in business afterward. Furthermore, if the company is publicly traded, it's stock value can drop dramatically after a data breach, as in the case of Equifax, Target, Yahoo, Sony, and many more.

**3. Revenue protection**
A detailed incident response saves your organization from the loss of revenue derived from the security incident. The financial effects of a security incident not only involve the loss of customers but also affect operational time. Then there is the potential economic loss if personal data is stolen, as in the case of the [Home Depot breach](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/home-depot-confirms-data-breach-a-7288), which involved more than 65 million customer credit and debit card accounts had a total breach cost of $62 million. More than half of small and medium organizations can go out of business after six months following a data breach. 

The reality is that the quicker your response to a security incident, the lesser impact it will have on your data, customer trust, reputation and revenues. If your organization doesn't currently have an incident response plan, a good option is to consider a [third-party incident response managed solution](https://www.exabeam.com/incident-response/incident-response-plan/) that can quickly implement a customized plan for you.   

## Six Steps To Build An Incident Response Plan
Typically, an incident response plan has six stages: 

**1. Preparation**
The first stage of the incident response plan is to define, analyze, identify, and prepare. As part of this preparation process there are several aspects you should define including: 
* The critical components of your network
* A security corporate policy including protocols for the appropriate usage of company data. 

**2. Identification**
At this stage, you should identify what consists of a security threat that activates the incident response team action. There is a difference between an unidentified USB found in the common lunchroom, and an alert of malware detected. You should define clear parameters of what triggers the response plan. 

**3. Containment**
Once the threat is detected, you need to immediately contain it. Short-term containment is an immediate response, isolating the affected files to avoid further damage. Long-term containment involves returning systems to production to enable bouncing back to business. 

**4. Restore**
The process of restoring affected systems involves reviewing them so you can remove any trace of the security incident. This is usually combined with measures to update your defense systems to prevent similar attacks in the future. 

**5. Recovery**
Define how are you going to bring the systems back into production once they are clean. At this stage, an efficient disaster recovery solution could be useful in minimizing data loss. 

**6. Lessons Learned**
This is the last stage, where you review the documentation of the incident and update the IR plan based on your findings. 


## Tips for a Succesful Incident Response Plan
Here are some tips that can help you succeed in implementing an incident response plan:

**1. Use multi-region replication and storage**—prioritize the backup of critical data and distribute them in several locations. This can help you recover the network quickly in case of disaster or attack. 

**2. Identify the single points of failure in your network**—single points of failure can expose the network in the event of an incident. You can minimize the impact of a disaster by establishing redundancies and using software failover features. 

**3. Train the rest of your staff for incident response**—everyone, not only IT, needs to understand the importance of the response plan. Create a security culture, where all departments cooperate with IT. This can reduce the impact of disruptions as well as reduce security risks. 

**4. Test the plan before you need it**—make a practice drill involving all relevant stakeholders. If necessary, you should inform partners and law enforcement. This can help you practice so when the event is real, everyone is prepared. 

## Conclusion
It’s evident that nowadays, with the ever-increasing threat of security breaches, every company must be prepared to affront an attack. It is not a matter of if an attack will occur, but when it will happen. Having a well laid-out plan, be it designed in-house or by a managed incident response solution, it is imperative to protect your data, your customers and your business.
