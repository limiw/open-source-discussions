This article overviews five open-source tools you can use to help you out with one of the most important processes involved in deriving value from data — [Extract, Transform, and Load](http://www.etldatabase.com/etl-process/) (ETL). 

## ETL & Data Warehousing
Organizations and businesses are becoming increasingly data-driven in their decision-making. These entities, whether they are not-for-profit charities or large enterprises, collect a wealth of information in their various IT systems, including databases, transactional systems, website analytics, and marketing software. 

The idea behind moving towards data-driven decisions is that such decisions tend to be more informed when they are backed up by hard data rather than using intuition and observation alone. However, it is difficult to make accurate decisions when you analyze organizational data from different sources in isolation. 

A data warehouse is a special type of data repository in which data is integrated into a common, aggregated format from all sources within an organization. The integrated data is then arranged within a data warehouse system in such a way as to make it optimized for analysis using various business intelligence tools, reporting tools, and data analytics software. (This [data warehouse guide](https://panoply.io/data-warehouse-guide/) goes more in-depth into the specifics of how a data warehouse works.)

A major challenge in the implementation of data warehouses is how to get data from various source systems and integrate it into a unified format that is optimized for analysis and reporting. This need for data integration is precisely the role that ETL fulfills. ETL typically combines three functions into the one tool, and it covers the extraction of data from source systems, its transformation into the right format and structure, and its loading into a data warehouse. 

One option is to hand-code the ETL process, but this is complex and time-consuming. Open source ETL tools exist that can help organizations ETL their data much more efficiently and at no cost. 

## Open Source ETL Solutions

**Pentaho Kettle**

Pentaho is a business intelligence suite that  is available in both open source and commercial versions. The specific Pentaho tool for ETL is Kettle, which runs on a JavaScript engine. This tool has a very intuitive graphical user interface and it interprets ETL processes written in XML format. You also get data visualization capabilities and analytics included. 

Kettle comes with easy drag-and-drop data integration and a scheduling component for coordinating ETL workflows. A potential disadvantage of Kettle is that is quite a computationally heavy tool that consumes a lot of memory and processing power. 

**Talend**

Talend Open Studio is an open-source data integration tool licensed under the Apache License. Talend comes with Eclipse-based developer tooling, the ability to map, aggregate, sort, and merge data, and master jobs to orchestrate ETL processes. Similar to Kettle, there is also drag-and-drop functionality. Talend has connectors to relational database systems like Microsoft SQL server, to SaaS solutions like Salesforce, and to CRM software. 

Open Studio is a limited version of an equivale yet more full-featured enterprise tool, and as a result, the open-source version is limited in comparison.   

**Apatar**

Apatar is an open-source data integration and ETL tool written in the Java language. There is a visual job designer that enables people who aren’t developers to connect different applications. The visual mapping extends to the tool’s data transformation functions, and you can perform or modify complex transformations via an intuitive GUI. You also get connectivity to all major data sources.  

**GeoKettle**

GeoKettle is a metadata-driven ETL tool specifically dedicated to [spatial data ](https://searchsqlserver.techtarget.com/definition/spatial-data), which is data about physical objects. This open-source tool is actually another version of Pentaho Kettle which has been specifically tailored to suit geospatial data, allowing you to extract, transform, and populate data into a data warehouse. 

You can extract data from spatial data sources residing in systems like PostGIS, Oracle spatial, and MySQL, spatial OLAP systems, and geo files. Among the included transformation capabilities are joining, mapping, scripting, filtering, and merging. There’s a GUI for visualizing and editing transformation rules. 

**Scriptella**

Scriptella is an open-source ETL and script execution tool written in the Java language. You can execute scripts written in SQL, JavaScript, JEXL, Velocity and other languages to perform data transformations. You can also perform cross-database ETL operations. This open-source project emphasizes low memory consumption and high-performance with a minimal burden on processors.  

## Wrap Up
Several open-source projects provide excellent options for data integration using ETL. Open-source versions of commercial tools are typically feature-limited, but they can be solid options for small-scale data pipelines. Furthermore, with some extra work in terms of configuring your open source ETL tools, you might find you get more out of them. 

It’s also worth considering that organizations are increasingly collecting continuous streams of data that they want to analyze in real-time for the most up to date insights. ETL tools, both open source and paid, need to be able to support this need going forward. Whichever tool you choose, don't forget to secure your data. There are open source security tools available. However, if you are not an expert, you might want to consider outsourcing the service to a [cybersecurity company](https://www.esecurityplanet.com/products/top-cybersecurity-companies.html).
