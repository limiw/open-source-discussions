# EDR Security: What It Is and Why You Need It

When you think about a cyber attack, you picture an attacker entering a network straight through a computer, right?  Wrong. Nowadays, attackers are entering the networks through connected portable devices such as phones, laptops, and tablets. The number of connected devices to any given network is ever increasing, widening the attack surface. 

Moreover, many attacks are bypassing traditional antiviruses, requiring solutions that proactively search for indicators of compromise across endpoints. In this article, we will define what is Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), and give you 4 reasons you should install an [EDR security](https://www.cynet.com/platform/threat-protection/edr-endpoint-detection-and-response/) solution today. 
## What Is Endpoint Detection and Response?
A set of software solutions and cybersecurity technologies that detects and remove malicious activity such as malware on a network’s endpoints. 

EDR solutions typically have the following features: 
* **Monitors endpoints for anomalous behavior**—detecting security threats at the endpoint. 
* **Prioritize alerts**—filtering out false positives. This prevents alert fatigue and helps the security team to focus on real threats. 
* **Blocks advanced threats**—from the moment they are detected. 
* **Contains the security incident on the endpoint**—by, for example, rerouting the malware to a sandbox where it can be detonated
* **Eliminates the threat**—by effectively removing dangerous files or in the case of file-less threats, eliminating the processes to restore the endpoint to safety. 
* **Protects against different threats at the same time**—such as malware, ransomware and memory attacks, for example. 

When we talk about protection against advanced threats, endpoint security has the advantage to protect the environment where the attack starts. 
## Why Do You Need EDR? 
Until recently,  the attackers would try to enter a network through a server or computer. Since the number of endpoints was contained within the company’s network, barriers such as antivirus and firewalls did the trick. The exponential growth of portable connected devices has changed this situation. 

With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), companies need to deal with a wider spectrum of connected devices, most of them belonging to customers and employees. Therefore, the attackers can have a field day, having a myriad of entry points to try to exploit. 
Wherever you have a device connected to the internet, you have a potential point of entry for an attacker. Organizations need to defend their network perimeter on thousands or laptops, phones and tablets, just to name a few. 

Another risk factor is the change in the work structure. Not long ago, employees would log in to the company system using the office computer. Today, remote work and bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies mean you can work wherever you can connect to the internet.  The point is, not all these networks are secure, with a lot of people connecting from coffee shops, or from pretty much any place with a wi-fi connection. This puts the organization’s network at risk, as innocent employees can get their devices hacked, and not-so-innocent ones can use their devices to perpetrate insider threats. 

How can an organization protect all these millions of connected endpoints? Using antivirus and firewall is not enough. EDR security solutions monitor, detect and respond to threats trying to affect the network that a signature-based solution cannot pick up. 
## Four Reasons to Install an EDR Solution
To actively block and respond to attackers threatening endpoints, more companies are choosing to deploy an EDR security solution across their network. That means every smartphone, laptop or computer connecting to the organization application or network is going to be actively protected by the EDR solution. Following we present you with four reasons to install an EDR solution today.
### 1. Continuous visibility across endpoints. 
EDR solutions allow the security team to check on the security posture at any moment. No network is 100% secure, and the lack of visibility often causes organizations to overlook attacks. Since the solution is continuously monitoring the network, proactively searching for threats, the security team can draw information about vulnerable areas anytime. Using EDR security provides the visibility to see where the organization’s security posture stands at the moment. Most solutions also generate automatic reports to comply with regulations. 
### 2. Unknown threats detection. 
Adds an additional layer of detection capabilities to find threats gone unnoticed by the antivirus. Most organizations will rely on passive prevention to defend their network perimeter from attackers. Sadly, this has proven not sufficient, as the more sophisticated the defenses, the more sophisticated the attackers are. Advanced threats will slip under a traditional antivirus or firewall, lurking undetected while causing damage to the systems. An EDR solution searches for indicators of compromise in all endpoints, elevating prioritized alerts to analyze their severity. EDR security solutions can enhance or replace antivirus systems since they look for complex threats, such as fileless attacks, that typically evade traditional antivirus. 
### 3. Faster incident response.
EDR solutions use behavior analysis to actively search for threats in the environment. Once it detects a security incident, the solution proceeds to contain the threat, by isolating the affected endpoints. This gives the security team the ability to respond quickly to security incidents, being that the EDR solution takes care of containment measures, without disrupting operations. This constant and proactive vigilance also helps organizations to deal faster with zero-day attacks. 
### 4. Easier visualization of lessons learned
Most EDR security solutions include forensic capabilities that provide a visual representation of the attack chain. The system collects data and generates reports at each step of the killer chain. This facilitates understanding which processes and files were affected by the attack, determining its impact. Moreover, since the system presents the patterns used by the attackers, it can help identify who is behind the attack. This reporting is a crucial step in preventing similar attacks in the future. 
## The Bottom Line
Most security analysts don’t ask if an attack will happen, but when. Failing to detect an attack at its starting point can have dire consequences for organizations, resulting in millions of dollars in damage caused by data breaches. Companies need to be able to control their perimeter wherever there is a device connected to their environment. Be it using their applications or login into their systems. Their best bet is to deploy a solution that can actively protect their network 24/7 across devices and users. Endpoint Detect and Response solutions can be the answer.
