Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a non-profit organization that provides tools and advisory documentation to help improve web application security worldwide. Read on to learn about the OWASP Top Ten, which is one of the organization’s most important documents for securing applications. You’ll also get ten tips to mitigate the OWASP Top Ten risks. 
## What Is the OWASP Top Ten?
The OWASP Top Ten is a document that spreads awareness about the most critical risks to web application security. Security experts worldwide share their knowledge and come to a consensus on the risks that the document should contain. The OWASP urges corporations, universities, government agencies, and other organizations to adopt the document and minimize the ten risks. 

OWASP releases an updated version of its top ten risks every few years—the latest one was released in November 2017. The risks on the latest [OWASP Top 10](https://www.owasp.org/images/7/72/OWASP_Top_10-2017_%28en%29.pdf.pdf) include injection, broken authentication, and sensitive data exposure. Data loss, litigation issues, leaked proprietary information, and loss of customer confidence are some of the consequences of a breached web application. 
## Mitigating OWASP Top Ten Risks

**1. Use Software Composition Analysis**

Risk A9 on the OWASP list is “using components with known vulnerabilities”. A number of high-profile cybersecurity incidents in recent times happened because organizations used vulnerable open source components. To protect against this risk, it is important to use software composition analysis (SCA) tools that can identify all components and their dependencies in web applications and check for vulnerabilities. 

The OWASP has its own free SCA utility, and this [OWASP Dependency Check guide](https://resources.whitesourcesoftware.com/home/owasp-dependency-check) provides details on the utility’s features and functionality. You can also get more advanced SCA solutions that provide dashboards and automated rules for vulnerability remediation. 

**2. Strengthen Application Authentication**

The second vulnerability (A2) on the list is broken authentication, which is when attackers bypass the authentication methods used by a web application. In web apps without automated [credential stuffing](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Credential_stuffing) protections, intruders can use lists of stolen/breached credentials and repeatedly try to access an application with automated login attempts. Weak passwords and incorrect session timeouts also contribute to broken authentication.

Protect against credential stuffing and brute force login attacks by adding multi-factor authentication. Other tips include using checks against weak user passwords and do not store session IDs in URLs. 

**3. Regularly Review Security Configurations**

In 2018, an open Amazon S3 bucket exposed the personal information of thousands of FedEx users. The OWASP Top Ten mentions this type of incident in its sixth (A6) web application security risk: Security Misconfiguration. Leaving important files and directories open, using out of date software, and leaving default accounts enabled are all examples of security misconfiguration. 

To combat this risk, regularly review security configurations to make sure everything is in order, especially cloud storage permissions. Apply the latest security updates to libraries and frameworks. 

**4. Prevent Cross Site Scripting (XSS)**

Cross Site Scripting (XSS) has the second highest prevalence of the ten web application security risks in OWASP’s document. XSS attackers insert malicious scripts into trusted websites, targeting unsuspecting users. XSS vulnerabilities are found in up to two-thirds of web applications.

Prevent XSS by using frameworks that are more resistant to XSS, such as Ruby on rails or React JS, but make sure you know about the limitations of their defenses too. Scan your source code for XSS vulnerabilities during development. Conduct penetration tests on your web apps before committing them to production. 

**5. Encrypt Your Data Properly**

Security risk A3 in the OWASP document highlights the issue of sensitive data exposure. Attackers frequently try to get access to sensitive data because information like credit card numbers, business secrets, and personal information are potentially lucrative. Some problems that expose web applications to sensitive data breaches are transmitting or storing data in clear text and using weak or old cryptography algorithms.

The main thing is to encrypt all sensitive data, whether it is at rest or in transit. Use strong up-to-date encryption algorithms and hashing functions for passwords. Don’t retain sensitive data if you don’t need it and make sure you classify sensitive data that is either processed, stored, or transmitted by an application. Apply appropriate controls for sensitive data at rest or in motion as governed by regulations such as GDPR or PCI DSS. 

**6. Use Thorough Logging and Monitoring**

Insufficient logging and monitoring is the final risk included in the top ten list, and its exploitation is the foundation for many major cyber attacks on web apps. Cybercriminals know that a lack of proper monitoring increases the time taken for security teams to respond to incidents, making their attacks more likely to succeed. 

Vulnerable applications tend not to log events such as failed logins or high-value transactions. Other signs of a vulnerability in logging and monitoring are unclear log messages, not monitoring logs for suspicious activity, and ineffective alerts or response escalation.

A thorough logging system must log all events with user context to identify suspicious or malicious accounts. Log management tools need to be in place for a holistic view of generated log messages. Set up automated monitoring and alerting to achieve faster responses to suspicious activity. 
 
## Conclusion

Whether you are a developer or part of an IT security team, it’s important to learn about the OWASP top ten. Organizations should understand that application security is not optional. Stakeholders need to put an organization-wide initiative in place to improve app security. Encourage different teams to work together efficiently, including security, software developers, and managers, to prevent critical security risks using the tips here as a guideline.
