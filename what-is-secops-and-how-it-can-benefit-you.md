In today’s technological landscape, entire global economies pour money into innovative ideas willy-nilly. Everyone wants to be ‘in’ on the next big wave of disruptive technologies. As enterprises race to win the next jackpot and individual consumers demand better and improved products, the cybersecurity perimeter is torn apart. 

The SecOps methodology can help organizations mend fragmented security perimeters by inviting all personnel to increase visibility through a collaborative effort. 
## What Is SecOps?
Security Operations (SecOps) is a methodology that merges security with operations. Traditionally, security teams work independently, and add their input between the testing and deployment stages of the waterfall methodology. In contrast, SecOps turns security into a collaborative process. 

SecOps is often considered a cultural effort, in which everyone shares the responsibility for ensuring the continued security of the organization. You can implement SecOps throughout the entire structure of your organization, or you can apply SecOps practices to one project. 

SecOps practices turn your security practices into a dynamic process that integrates tools, practices, goals, and [automation](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3065296/why-automation-is-the-key-to-the-future-of-cyber-security.html) with operations.
## DevOps vs SecOps - What Is the Difference?
SecOps and Development Operations (DevOps) have different goals, which sometimes contrast each other. While the main aim of DevOps is to deploy and maintain software quickly and efficiently, the SecOps methodology cares for the continued health of the software and the network.

Problems arise when the goal to secure the software conflicts with the goal to deliver the software. Sometimes, the only way to maintain security is by introducing network latency. While this solution works for the SecOps team, the DevOps team would worry about the lost time. 

Bridging the gap between continual security and fast delivery can be difficult, but possible. When organizations adopt the [SecOps](https://www.exabeam.com/siem-guide/siem-concepts/secops/) mindset, everyone share responsibility for security concerns. Thus, security standards are met at every organizational level.
## What Are the Goals of SecOps?
The SecOps methodology was established in order to ensure that security concerns are met during: 
* **Every stage of the development** - whether you’re using the waterfall methodology, the agile method, or DevOps, you can apply SecOps to your pipeline. It might be easier for organizations that have already transitioned to DevOps, because they’re used to a collaborative effort. Waterfall practitioners might need a period of adjustment, as many personnel will find themselves in charge with the additional responsibilities of security.
* **At every organizational level** - applying SecOps to your organization or project means ensuring all the parties involved become accountable to security standards. That includes non-IT personnel who use company assets and visitors who use your Wi-Fi. Create a straightforward policy and ensure that your personnel gain the knowledge and skills necessary to uphold it.
* **By any foreign entity that comes into contact with the organization** - the days of desktop software are slowly and surely disappearing. As cloud computing gains track, companies use third-party resources more often. When you introduce third-party tools into your technological ecosystem, especially if you’re enabling integration - make sure that the third-party entity meets your security standards. 

To ensure that your SecOps approach is practiced, you will need the cooperation of all parties involved. Make sure that your team has clear guidelines, and make adjustments along the way. Provide your personnel with tools that enable collaboration, like [project management](https://project-management.com/top-10-project-management-software/) or [task management software](https://project-management.com/task-management-software/).
## What Are the Benefits of SecOps?
According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/595182/worldwide-security-as-a-service-market-size/), the global cybersecurity market is expected to jump from $167 billion in 2019 to $248 billion in 2023. Every year, new forms of technology disrupt the global economy. Advancements and innovations integrate swiftly into the life of the individual and the infrastructure of the organization. The traditional security perimeter has been breached the moment cloud computing entered the business sphere. 

Nowadays, every time employees use a smartphone to access a cloud-hosted document, they breach the security perimeter. The main benefit of adopting the SecOps methodology is the ability to cover more security ground. When employees are educated in proper security protocols, they can serve as security agents - protecting the organization from their own personal devices.

Once you achieve holistic security practices in your organization, you’ll be able to see improvements in the following areas:
* **Improved productivity** - when security is integrated at every level, employees can work more efficiently. Collaboration helps pass the information faster, reducing the response and mitigation time.
* **Higher Return On Investment (ROI)** - when security is distributed throughout all channels, you get the chance to cut back on overhead. You can reduce expenses because everyone shares the same tools, and expensive third-party services can be consolidated into one or two in-house roles.
* **Increased efficiency via shared resources** - appropriate tools are key to enabling efficient collaboration between all teams. You can use tools with granular access control to ensure that relevant personnel gains appropriate access and authorization. Sharing resources help provide everyone with what they need at key moments.
* **Reduced application and service disruptions** - when all of the organization is united under a dynamic security endeavor, the collaborative effort ensures quick response time. As all relevant personnel join forces to fix the issue, they reduce the application and service disruptions.
* **Streamlined security audit** - whether you’re using manual audits, automation tools, or exercise a double-sword practice that covers both bases - you can streamline the audit process by distributing auditing tasks. This will ensure there’s no backlog and issues can be caught on a timely manner.  
* **Enhance visibility of security vulnerabilities** - when everyone is set to the task of securing the organization, you can catch vulnerabilities faster. Nowadays, there are so many vulnerabilities, we need [vulnerability libraries](https://blog.bitsrc.io/open-source-security-risks-and-vulnerabilities-to-know-in-2019-8354058f6ad3) to keep track of everything. When everyone keeps an eye for vulnerabilities, you gain more visibility.
## The Future of SecOps: DevSecOps
The DevSecOps methodology unifies the practices of DevOps and SecOps under one umbrella. By adopting DevSecOps, you can make sure that security concerns are met at every stage of the software lifecycle. The most important aspect of DevSecOps is that it settles the inherent conflicts between SecOps and DevOps.

By merging the two methodologies together, you get a cohesive security and development cycle. Say goodbye to the battles waged about the importance of fixing security issues vs the importance of fast software delivery. When security and development unite under DevSecOps, you can expect more collaborative solutions, born out of a dynamic and healthy work environment.
