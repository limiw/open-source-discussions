## 5 Open Source Cloud Platforms for the Enterprise

Enterprise cloud adoption continues to soar, and [recent estimates](https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2018/01/07/83-of-enterprise-workloads-will-be-in-the-cloud-by-2020/) suggest that 83 percent of enterprise workloads will be in the cloud by 2020. Itâ€™s almost automatic for many businesses to jump straight to the most popular, commercial names when considering a cloud service. 

Amazon Web Services, Google, and Microsoft Azure are some of the largest commercial cloud service providers, and they pretty much dominate the market. However, a range of additional commercial options, such as [Azure storage optimization](https://cloud.netapp.com/blog/azure-storage-behind-the-scenes) services, now exist that complement the services of Azure and AWS and promise to improve cost efficiency. 

Despite the success of commercial cloud platforms, a growing number of enterprises are shifting towards open source cloud platforms. Aside from the obvious benefit of lower costs, the open source model enables greater vendor agnosticism in the cloud while also being a more flexible choice for developers. With this in mind, take a look at the following five open source cloud platforms you might want to consider.

**1. OpenStack**

OpenStack is a popular cloud platform that provides the tools to build out public and private clouds. The platform revolves around a set of core services, including compute, networking, identity management, and storage among others. In this sense, it is a collection of loosely related software for building public or private clouds.

There is a web-based administrative dashboard for viewing, provisioning, and orchestrating resources. Developers can also manage resources using command-line tools or by interacting with the [OpenStack RESTful API](https://developer.openstack.org/api-guide/quick-start/). 

The modular architectural design makes OpenStack an attractive option for working with different open source components and not relying on a single vendor in addition to facilitating easy application scalability and elasticity. 

**2 . WSO2**

WSO2 Cloud is a PaaS offering released under the Apache License for hosting APIs in the cloud, and integrating applications and web services cloud-to-cloud or cloud-to-on-premise. 

There is also WSO2 Identity Cloud which provides single sign-on and centralized monitoring and reporting for your cloud-based applications for prudent identity access management. The user portal provides an application catalog for employees to easily discover the apps they need to use, and the sign on is useful in reducing the headaches that come with managing multiple credentials across different services and systems. 

Low monthly subscription fees, fully functional free trials, and automated scaling are also attractive features of this open source cloud platform. There is also a managed cloud option.

**3. Cloudify**

This open source software cloud orchestration platform simplifies deploying new applications in the cloud, and it is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. A set of recipes or blueprints are used to model your apps, and they include configurations, services, and dependencies. Cloudify uses these blueprints to automate the deployment of apps to cloud infrastructure. 

Cloudify encourages collaboration and sharing of blueprint files so that Devs and Ops are working from the same page, accelerating deployment to the cloud. This is important in an Agile environment where development teams are under pressure to release software fast and frequently. 

**4. Eucalyptus**

Eucalyptus is an open-source cloud platform that enables you to build private or hybrid cloud environments using existing clusters and server infrastructure. You can configure and provision compute, network, and storage resources via the Eucalyptus user interface, and the cloud environments you build are AWS-compatible. 

The commands in Eucalyptus manage both private Eucalyptus instances and public AWS EC2 instances, the combination of which gives a hybrid cloud environment. Each user gets an identity and administrators can group users together to exercise access control, and you can get even more fine-grained control over cloud resources by integrating Eucalyptus user identity management with [LDAP](https://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/definition/LDAP) systems.

Eucalyptus is not as popular as it once was, and the company that maintained it from 2014, DXC, stopped developing it in 2017. The project has been forked, however, and AppScale Systems now provides technical support for customers. 

**5. Cloud Forms**

Cloud Forms is a Red Hat infrastructure management platform for private clouds and virtualized infrastructure. You get visualization into all private cloud resources and you can automate the provisioning of new resources. 

Cloud Forms has a strong emphasis on compliance, and it allows you to easily apply corporate governance policies across your cloud environments and obtain compliance data on all of your resources. 


## Wrap Up

Consider these open source platforms as solid alternatives to the more obvious commercial choices if you want greater flexibility in your cloud deployments without being tied to certain vendors. 

Open source has already made a huge impact on enterprise development, and as companies look to become more informed on their cloud choices, the open source model looks set to grow in influence on the cloud market over the coming years.
