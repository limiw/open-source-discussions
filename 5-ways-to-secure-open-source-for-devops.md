DevOps development practices shorten development life cycles and improve the overall efficiency of release delivery for software projects. Collaboration, automation, continuous testing, and various tools help to achieve the aims of DevOps practices. 

Open source empowers DevOps practices by providing developers with well-built libraries, frameworks, and other components they can use as the building blocks of the software they release. The security of open source code is an important topic in DevOps. Read on to find out why security is so vital and five ways to secure open source in DevOps teams. 

## Open Source and DevOps
The average commercially developed application contains [257 open source components](https://news.slashdot.org/story/18/05/22/1727216/the-percentage-of-open-source-code-in-proprietary-apps-is-rising). Additionally, several of the open source tools used by DevOps teams are open source, including Jenkins, Apache Maven, and  JUnit. 

Not only does open source save money and make development more efficient, but its core tenet of collaboration also aligns well with what DevOps is all about. It’s clear that open source and DevOps is a powerful combination that drives faster time to market with frequent updates, fixes, and new features. However, for DevOps and open source to truly work together, it’s time to think more about security. 

## DevOps and Open Source Security
A problem with open source and DevOps is that security tends to get left as an afterthought. Open source vulnerabilities have been the cause of several high-profile cybersecurity incidents in recent times. Everyone knows about Equifax, which was caused by not updating a vulnerable version of an open source web framework. 

There is a need to shift security left and embed it into the software development cycle from the start of development if security is going to improve in DevOps teams. Bolting security on at the end of development leads to inadvertent vulnerabilities and insecure code. 
## Tips to Improve Open Source Security in DevOps

**1. Culturally Adapt to DevSecOps**

The first aim is to get developers and operations workers on board with the idea of security being embedded into the entire product lifecycle from design to development to delivery and support. Shifting left and keeping developers and operations happy means making sure DevOps efficiency and speed are not compromised. This resource reviews the specific [DevOps security challenges](https://resources.whitesourcesoftware.com/blog-whitesource/shifting-security-left-3-devsecops-challenges-how-to-overcome-them) of shifting left. 

The cultural adaptation of going from DevOps to DevSecOps requires embedding application security functions, tools, and tests throughout the DevOps workflow. Frank and honest communication with DevOps teams is crucial. You need to drive home the importance of releasing secure applications, particularly in relation to using open source components. 

In a DevSecOps culture, security teams work alongside developers and operations to secure software with reduced technical debt and waiting times for security tests.

**2. Automate Security**

Automation lies at the heart of DevOps. A reason for the traditional misalignment between security and DevOps is that code commits far outpace the speed at which security teams can review the code properly. Security automation can overcome any cultural resistance to a DevSecOps approach. 

Automation in security processes like configuration checks, code analysis, patch management, and vulnerability scanning is imperative if security is going to be successfully embedded in DevOps workflows. Security teams need to prioritize deploying automated software to identify vulnerable open source code, and the earlier they can find such vulnerabilities, the cheaper it is to fix them.  

**3. Create an Open Source Policy**

An open source policy establishes guidelines and rules around using open source components in applications. Security teams can create a policy that helps the transition to DevSecOps by emphasizing that application security is everyone’s responsibility. Organizations can look to freely available examples of internal open source policies like [Google’s](https://opensource.google.com/docs/) for inspiration.

By providing a framework for DevOps teams on how to securely source and use open source code, a policy can help mitigate many technical, legal, and business risks. Advise developers to use only open source code from trusted repositories and to regularly check vulnerability databases. 

The policy should also focus on tools and processes that help security teams draw up a Bill of Materials showing all components used to build software. Greater visibility into open source components reduces the risk of using vulnerable or out of date code. 

**4. Track Security Throughout**

Security needs to remain visible throughout DevOps workflows. Task or project management tools need to include tracking for security processes and checks to maintain good visibility. Integrating security frameworks with DevOps tools like Jenkins and Ansible via API endpoints can ensure security checks work seamlessly in CI/CD pipelines. 

**5. Encourage Application Security Training**

Security professionals can train developers in the basics of application security with an emphasis on open source. The training can cover using automated security tools and ways to verify if code is safe as developers are working on it. Many undergraduate computer science degrees don’t focus on secure software development in their modules. 
Alongside a good policy, this training equips development teams with the security-first knowledge needed to avoid vulnerabilities slipping into software. 

## Conclusion

Open source code facilitates the achievement of a DevOps culture, however, too many organizations neglect security as part of their DevOps cultural shift. Introducing security early into development cycles reduces potential vulnerabilities from open source code while also unearthing problems earlier when they are easier and less expensive to fix. 

Follow the best practices to help establish security as a pillar of successful software development in DevOps environments with functional software that is more resistant to data breaches and other cyber threats.
